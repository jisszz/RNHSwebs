    <h1>Home Economics </h1>
    <h2>(HE)</h2><br><br>


<div class="p">Within a school curriculum, the study of home economics is sometimes 
    described as life education. Because much of an individual’s life has traditionally 
    centered upon the home and the family, home economics has been largely concerned 
    with learning how to deal with the problems and challenges of homemaking. A basic 
    knowledge of home economics helps a person make up a workable household budget, plan 
    and prepare nutritious meals, choose a fabric for draperies, and care for a small child.<br>

    In recent years the scope of home economics has broadened considerably. It now includes 
    areas of national and international interest. Today’s home economist may, for example, 
    be engaged in developing foods for space flights, providing answers to the nutritional 
    problems of underdeveloped nations, or setting up national classifications for textiles.<br>
    
    The study of home economics encompasses a wide variety of subjects, including foods and
     nutrition; clothing and textiles; housing, home equipment, and home management; family 
     economics; child development; and family relations. Home economists are often required to 
     have academic preparation in such related areas as chemistry, physics, sociology, 
     psychology, and design.<br>
