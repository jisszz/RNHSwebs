    <h2> THE CREATION OF RNHS</h2><br><br><br>

    <p>
        The Rosales National High School which caters to secondary
        school youths of Rosales and its neighboring towns, Rosales National
        High School was founded in 1945 through the initiative of public school
        officials and prominent and civic- spirited of the town, namely: the late
        Mayor Felix Coloma, Dona Petra Callanta, Don Francisco delos Reyes,
        Don Isidro Casanova, Don Conrado Estrella Sr. In September 1945, the 
        school then known as Rosales Junior High School has under each educa
        tional wing the first year students in 1941 that were overtaken by the out
        break of the Pacific war in World War II on December 8, 1941. The fresh
        men and sophomore classes were housed temporarily in the Plaridel Col
        lege Building.<br>      
        From Plaridel College, the school was transferred to another site
        which is currently occupied by the Rosales North Central School where
        Quonset Buildings vacated by the American Soldiers were then used as
        classrooms.<br>
        While classes were going on, the founding fathers and the PTA ne
        gotiated for the purchased of a permanent site, meticulously chosen be
        cause of its healthful environment that is conducive to learning, more foot
        age to futuristic expansion and its ideal location in terms of proximity to
        the main thoroughfares of the town.<br>
        Assured of the funds, the PTA Board of Directors negotiated with the heirs
        of the late Mr. Alejandro Pablo regarding the contemplated purchase of his
        lot situated in the Poblacion of Rosales.<br>
        The new site has an area of 72, 634 square meters under title 22452
        registered on February 9, 1957 under TCT No. 1029. It cost the PTA Php
        50,843.20 as down payment to acquire the cogonal land.<br>
        In S.Y 1946-1947, the PTA was determined to transfer the school
        to the chosen site. For donations of parents and civic spirited citizens,
        shacks were constructed and were furnished by the facilities of the Plaridel
        College donated by Dona Teodora Serafica and family. In this school site
        were enrolled 51 fourth year students and 200 first year students. The first
        class of 32 males and 16 females were graduated.<br>
        As time goes by, there are also many changes happened in the school
        in terms of the buildings, curricula, number of teachers and number of students.
        Currently, the total number of enrollees in school is about 5,151 as of march
        4, 2018. In that case the Rosales NHS is one of the biggest National High School
        in Division of Pangasinan II.<br>
        In terms of acquisition of learning, before it is only a matter of learning, 
        just giving the ideas to the learners in order for them to internalized on what 
        is going on and on what will be in the next generation but today, it is not 
        just ingesting of ideas but it is more one practical matter, the of learning today 
        is more on hands-on-minds-on process it focuses on out-come based whrein in 
        all things that they have learned must put into action.<br><br>
