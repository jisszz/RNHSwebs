<div class="p">Information Communication and Technology or ICT Strand is one of the strands 
    offered under Technical-Vocational Livelihood (TVL) Track of K-12 curriculum. ICT strand 
    subjects seek to teach students concepts and skills in information technology. Under ICT 
    curriculum, students will learn how to write programs and design websites. This will also 
    help them hone their skills in animation and illustration which will help them thrive in 
    the creative field. Aside from these, ICT strand will also cover telecom installation and 
    medical transcription.<br>

    Taking ICT strand subjects is a good starting point if you want to take IT-related courses 
    in college. Learning the basic concepts will give enrollees of ICT strand enough edge to 
    excel. Aspiring programmers may choose to study software and network engineering. Those who
    want to enter jobs in the creative field may take multimedia arts, digital illustration, 
    animation, and graphic arts. These are just some courses that await ICT students in college.<br>
    
    Graduates of ICT will also get a certificate from TESDA upon passing the exam. This will grant 
    them more chances to get hired as soon as they enter the workforce. Thus, taking ICT strand in 
    senior high school will give more students a chance to build their career in the growing field 
    of IT.<br>
