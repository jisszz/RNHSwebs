                tion Decree of 1863 as the Superior Comission of Primary Instruction
                under a Chairman. The Education agency underwent many reorganization
                efforts in the 20th century in order to better define its purpose vis a vis the
                changing administrations and charters. The present day Department of Ed
                ucation was eventually mandated through Republic Act 9155, otherwise
