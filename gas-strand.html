<div class="p">GAS is an acronym for General Academic Strand. It takes a general approach 
    to prepare students for university life. Compared to other strands, students can expect 
    to tackle different disciplines. This can cover various subjects and topics such as 
    Humanities, Management, Social Sciences, and even Organization.<br>

    The GAS strand is created to cater to students who prefer a broader range of studies 
    rather than specific fields. It offers SHS students the flexibility to choose electives 
    from various strands, which helps in choosing a university degree.<br>
    
    After completing the subjects in the GAS strand, students can expect to feel prepared 
    to take on almost any course in university since these subjects provide them with a 
    solid foundation. Students who take the GAS strand will also feel more flexible when 
    picking their specialization later.  <br>
